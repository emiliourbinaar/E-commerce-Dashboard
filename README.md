## Dataset

The dashboard expects a file named **`data.csv`** in the project root.  
It uses the [UCI Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) (or any CSV with the same schema):

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `InvoiceNo` | string | Invoices starting with `C` = cancellation |
| `StockCode` | string | Product identifier |
| `Description` | string | Product name |
| `Quantity` | int | Negative = return / adjustment |
| `InvoiceDate` | datetime | Format `M/D/YYYY H:MM` |
| `UnitPrice` | float | Per-unit price in £ |
| `CustomerID` | float | Can be missing |
| `Country` | string | Customer country |

Place `data.csv` in the **same directory as `app.py`** before running.

## Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone / download the project
git clone <repo-url>
cd ecommerce_dashboard

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Place data.csv in the project root, then launch
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push the project to a **public GitHub repository** (ensure `data.csv` is included).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with GitHub.
3. Click **"New app"** → select your repo, branch (`main`), and set the **Main file path** to `app.py`.
4. Click **Deploy**. Streamlit Cloud automatically installs `requirements.txt`.

> **File size note:** `data.csv` is ~45 MB. GitHub's 100 MB per-file limit is not an issue, but if you use Git LFS you may need to configure it for `.csv` files.
